#+TITLE: CMake Files Api Client for Vim

A Files API client for Vim and Neovim.

* Introduction

Vector-of-bool's Cmake tools plugin for Visual Studio Code is a very good
piece of software which integrates really well CMake's understanding of
a codebase into the editor.

This plugin stub will try to set correctly a client for the coming CMake
file api in Vim so it can access these informations more easily

* Requirements

- Cmake 3.14 for its
  [[https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/blob/master/Help/manual/cmake-file-api.7.rst][new
  file API]]
- Vim 8 / Neovim 0.3

* Stateful Queries

** TODO Write files in the correct folder
** TODO Create the folder
** TODO Choose the build directory
** TODO Handle update events
** TODO Write JSON files from dictionaries

* Reply files

** TODO Read JSON files into dictionaries
** TODO Sort the data in a sorting that 'makes sense'

* Interface with other tools

** TODO List candidates interested in the information
** TODO Find the format for output data
